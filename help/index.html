                Vampire Survivors is a gothic horror casual game with rogue-lite elements, where your choices can allow you to quickly snowball against the hundreds of monsters that get thrown at you. It's a time survival game with minimalistic gameplay and roguelite elements. There's no place where to hide, all you can do is try to survive a cursed night and get as much gold as possible for the next survivor, before Death inevitably puts an end to your struggles.

              <li class="helpTitle">How to play ?</li>
              <span class="marge">
                The game is still in development. However, it already has many features. For the gameplay... IT'S A CLICKER, no need to say more :) <br>
                To go into the details of how it works. Just attack your enemies to kill them and earn money and experience. The money will be used to buy sturdy allies who will automatically attack for you. It is possible to improve the attacks as well as your heroes. The heroes are not all available from level 1. You will have to gain experience to unlock them. Finally, a strange timer is probably running out at the top of the screen when you play. The latter will increase up to 30 minutes. From 30 minutes you unlock the possibility of meeting "Death" ;) <br>
                When the 30 minutes are reached, and all the elites have been defeated, you will be allowed to change areas. (the area system is under development).
